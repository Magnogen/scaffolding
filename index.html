    <h1>
        The Cat Who Couldn't Catch, and the Mischievous Mouse
    </h1>
    <p>
        There once was a cat who did fall<br>
        Down the stairs, and it hit the wall<br>
        It got up, shook its head<br>
        And meowed, "I'm not dead!"<br>
        And then ran off, feeling quite small
    </p>
    <p>
        There once was a mouse who did spy<br>
        The cat tumbling down from on high<br>
        He laughed and he chuckled<br>
        As the feline did stumble<br>
        But then quickly ran off, lest the cat catch his eye
    </p>
    <p>
        The mouse scurried away with such speed<br>
        As the cat chased him with all of her greed<br>
        He darted and he dodged<br>
        Through the halls and the corridors<br>
        While the cat tripped and stumbled, in desperate need
    </p>
    <p>
        But the mouse was too quick for the clumsy cat<br>
        And he easily evaded her attack<br>
        He disappeared in a flash<br>
        Leaving the cat to crash<br>
        Exhausted and defeated, on the floor flat
    </p>
    <p>
        The cat lay there, feeling quite vexed<br>
        She had lost the mouse, and felt perplexed<br>
        She pondered her fate<br>
        As she lay in a state<br>
        Of contemplation, feeling quite vexed
    </p>
    <p>
        "Why do I always end up in this mess?"<br>
        She thought to herself, with a bit of distress<br>
        "I must find a new way<br>
        To catch my prey<br>
        Or else I'll be doomed to this distress"
    </p>
    <p>
        And so the cat rose, with determination clear<br>
        She would catch the mouse, never fear<br>
        She would train and she'd practice<br>
        Until she became quite adept<br>
        At catching her prey, never fearing defeat!
    </p>
    <p>
        The cat began to train in the cat-gym<br>
        With her alley cat friend, feeling quite prim<br>
        She worked on her speed<br>
        And her strength, indeed<br>
        Determined to catch that mouse, on a whim
    </p>
    <p>
        She practiced her pounce, and her stalking techniques<br>
        She even signed up for a mouse-catching retreat<br>
        She was determined to win<br>
        And catch that mouse, within<br>
        And finally put an end to her defeat
    </p>
    <p>
        And so, with hard work and dedication<br>
        The cat became a mouse-catching sensation<br>
        She prowled through the house<br>
        With stealth and with grace<br>
        And finally caught her prey, with elation!
    </p>
    <p>
        The mouse, who had once run in fear<br>
        Was now caught by the cat, who held him dear<br>
        But as she looked in his eyes<br>
        She realized with surprise<br>
        That the mouse was just as afraid as she
    </p>
    <p>
        And so, with a kind and gentle paw<br>
        The cat set the mouse free to roam once more<br>
        She watched as he scurried away<br>
        And realized that day<br>
        That they were not so different, after all
    </p>
    <p>
        The cat and the mouse, they coexisted peacefully<br>
        No longer enemies, but rather company<br>
        They learned to respect<br>
        And accept<br>
        Each other's differences, so naturally
    </p>
    <p>
        And so the story ends, with a lesson learned<br>
        That even foes can be friends, if they're open to be turned<br>
        By understanding and love, we can find harmony<br>
        Like the cat and the mouse, so happily.
    </p>
